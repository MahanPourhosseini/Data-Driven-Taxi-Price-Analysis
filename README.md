### Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of online taxi pricing, focusing on identifying factors that influence fare rates, customer behavior in response to price changes, and optimal pricing strategies. Utilizing a dataset with attributes such as ride requests, pricing, distances, and durations, we applied Python and libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, and Pandas for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.

### Objectives
- To analyze peak and off-peak hours' impact on taxi pricing.
- To investigate the effect of distance and expected duration on fares.
- To understand passenger and driver behavior concerning pricing strategies.
- To develop a predictive model for dynamic pricing.

### Key Features
- **Data Processing & Exploration**: Leveraging Python for advanced data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Employing machine learning techniques to forecast pricing and demand.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Analyzing cancellations and preferences related to price adjustments.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy and SciPy for numerical and scientific computing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

### Contributors
This project was a collaborative effort, providing insights into improving online taxi services' efficiency and profitability through data-driven decision-making.
